# What The Song!
What The Song is a Telegram bot that helps you find a forgotten song name!
It's a Telegram bot that users can send a song by their voice, whistling or humming! The bot sends their voice to a Telegram channel, asking other members to determine the song.

Users can forward the song message from channel to the bot and answer. The bot sends answers to the user asked it and the user can choose this answer is right, wrong or junk! From this feedback users get scores.

If a user sends junks, he/she will be blocked by 24 hours to 1 year! depending on how many times he/she did it.
